Add more post types to your WordPress installation. This provides an interface to the built in functionality of WordPress 3.0.

== Description ==

This is an early beta - fixes and better documentation to come. Promise.

With WordPress 3.0 the functionality to create post types will be built into core so what we’ve done is to break this functionality out of More Fields. But we thought it would be nice to be able to simplify the creation of additional post types (you add them via actions in your themes functions.php file as default). And we’ve also simplified the way to manage user roles and their capababilities with the created post types. And since we’re developers too we realised that there need to be an option to export these types to help transitioning from a development site to a live site (if you work on a development server and deploy on the live site). (Btw, that functionality will also be added to More Fields.)

== Installation ==

To install More Fields:

1. Upload the 'more-types' folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Setup your new post types in Settings -> More Types
