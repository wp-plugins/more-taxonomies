Add more taxonomies, besides categories or tags, to your WordPress installation. Also allows you to edit built in taxonomies.

== Description ==

More Taxonomies is a plugin that adds new taxonomies to the WordPress admin. For instance if you run a football site you could create a team taxonomy (based on the tags) and set teams on your posts relating to a specific game. If you run a music blog you could create a taxonomy for artists, musicians or perhaps producers.

If you use More Taxonomies in addition to More Types you could for instance add a taxonomy to a specific post type for courses—like appetizer, entrée, relevés, main course, salad or dessert.

With More Taxonomies you can:

* Create additional taxonomies
* Set different editing capabilities for taxonomies based on user roles (rights to review, save, and publish), even for built in taxonomies
* List taxonomy items in specific menus in the WordPress admin

More Taxonomies is part of a suite of plugins created to enhance the functionality of a vanilla WordPress installation. With More Fields you can create additional input fields for easier management of Custom fields, with More Types you can create additional post types besides Posts and Pages. More Taxonomies works without the other plugins but interacts with them nicely.

This plugins was born out of the development work done for [Dagensskiva](http://dagensskiva.com/), [Dagensbok](http://dagensbok.com/) and user requests.

1. Upload the 'more-taxonomies' folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
